# autoencoders-in-credit-card-anomaly-detection
Using auto-encoders for unsupervised learning to find anomalous customers applying for loans/credit.

Implemented using keras for building the autoencoder, sci-kit learn for metrics, and seaborn/matplotib for visualization.

NOTE: Model is trained on 700 images from the data set. With bigger datasets, accuracy of the model can be improved.
Current model has an accuracy of ~65%.
